  ## Description
  This project was created as a space for me to try out random ideas to improve my coding skills! I am currently working on improving my dayPlanner project found in my repositories so that it may become a calenderPlanner!


  ## Usage
  Provided usage instructions and examples insure the desired development environment and outcome:

    Select a time slot which you wish to occupy with a task.

    After clicking the save button your task will be saved to local storage until it is cleared

    
    Click on a day of the week to have the date displayed at the top of the page.

    Use the forward and back arrows located at the beginning and end of the month/year
    to navigate the calendar to any point in time


  ## Questions
What are some future development ideas associted with the calendarPlanner application?

    - The ability to input tasks on future days
    - Create filters for re-ocurring events that can be switched on/off
    - Responsive calendar with a clean, easy to navigate UI

    -implement above features into calendar application to have a full functioning calendar
